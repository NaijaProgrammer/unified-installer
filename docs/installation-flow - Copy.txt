1. User navigates to unified-installer using their browser, and is presented the installation form
2. Unified installer creates the unified configuration file in the directory housing the plugins (using values entered by user in the installation form)
3. Unified installer navigates to the installer page of the first plugin in-line to be installed
4. Plugin installer page includes the 'unified-installer-setup.php' file (and installation form)
5. 'unified-installer-setup.php' file creates a local copy of the 'unified-installer-check.php' by copying the one from the /unified-installer directory to current plugin's directory
6. 'unified-installer-setup.php' file then redirects to current plugin's 'basic-config-setup.php' file
7. Current plugin's 'basic-config-setup.php' file then includes the (above created) local copy of the 'unified-installer-check.php' file
8. Local 'unified-installer-check.php' file checks to ensure that the unified configuration file exists
9. Current plugin's 'basic-config-setup.php' file then uses the values from the unified configuration file to create the plugin's app-confing file and runs the installation of the plugin
10. On installe complete, page is redirected to the finalizer page, /unified-installer/unified-installer-finalize.php file
11. the finalizer page does the following:
    A. removes the just installed plugin from the plugins-to-install stack
    B. deletes the local copy of the 'unified-installer-check.php' file, as it is no longer needed
    C. checks to see if the plugins-to-install stack is empty:
       b. if not empty, it gets the next plugin in line from the plugins-to-install stack and navigates to its install page (from whence steps 4 - 11 is repeated again) 
       a. if empty, it redirects to the installation-complete-url specified by user in the installation form
